# Villages

Villages are the administrative units that come after districts among Turkey's administrative divisions. Each district is divided into one or more villages. There are more than 18,000 villages in Turkey. By default, the API lists all villages first by the provinces they belong to, then by the districts they belong to, and then by their names.

::: info INFO
The provinces that villages belong to are not metropolitan municipalities. (`isMetropolitan: false`)
:::

The entry URL for villages is: `/api/v1/villages`.

## Village Properties

Village resources have the following properties:

- `provinceId`: Province ID that the village belongs to
- `districtId`: District ID that the village belongs to
- `id`: Village ID
- `province`: Name of the province that the village belongs to
- `district`: Name of the district that the village belongs to
- `name`: Village name
- `population`: Village population

## Getting Multiple Village Data

To get all villages, you only need to use the village URL. For example, you can use a URL like `/api/v1/villages` to get all villages.

```url
https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages
```

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages
```

```javascript [fetch]
fetch('https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

:::

If your request is successful, the API will return a response like this:

::: details Sample Response {open}

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": [
    {
      "provinceId": 2,
      "districtId": 1105,
      "id": 37777,
      "province": "Adıyaman",
      "district": "Merkez",
      "name": "100.yıl",
      "population": 60
    },
    {
      "provinceId": 2,
      "districtId": 1105,
      "id": 631,
      "province": "Adıyaman",
      "district": "Merkez",
      "name": "Ağaçkonak",
      "population": 170
    }
    // Other villages...
  ]
}
```

:::

## Getting Single Village Data

To get data for a single village, you can create a URL like `/api/v1/villages/{id}` using the village ID. For example, you can use the URL `/api/v1/villages/37777` to get the village with ID `37777`.

```url
https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages/37777
```

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages/37777
```

```javascript [fetch]
fetch('https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/villages/37777')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

:::

If your request is successful, the API will return a response like this:

::: details Sample Response {open}

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": {
    "provinceId": 2,
    "districtId": 1105,
    "id": 37777,
    "province": "Adıyaman",
    "district": "Merkez",
    "name": "100.yıl",
    "population": 60
  }
}
```

## Querying

To query the API, you can add query parameters to the URL. For example, you can use the `provinceId` parameter to get villages in a specific province.
