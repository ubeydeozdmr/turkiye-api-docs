# Neighborhoods

Neighborhoods are administrative units that come after districts in Turkey's administrative divisions. Each district is divided into one or more neighborhoods. There are a total of 32,186 neighborhoods in Turkey. By default, the API lists all neighborhoods first by the provinces they belong to, then by the districts they belong to, and finally by their names.

The entry URL for neighborhoods is: `/api/v1/neighborhoods`.

## Neighborhood Properties

Neighborhood resources have the following properties:

- `provinceId`: The ID of the province the neighborhood belongs to
- `districtId`: The ID of the district the neighborhood belongs to
- `id`: The neighborhood's ID
- `province`: The name of the province the neighborhood belongs to
- `district`: The name of the district the neighborhood belongs to
- `name`: The neighborhood's name
- `population`: The neighborhood's population

## Getting Multiple Neighborhood Data

To get all neighborhoods, you only need to use the neighborhood URL. For example, you can use a URL like `/api/v1/neighborhoods` to get all neighborhoods.

```url
https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods
```

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods
```

```javascript [fetch]
fetch('https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

:::

If your request is successful, the API will return a response like this:

::: details Example Response {open}

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": [
    {
      "provinceId": 1,
      "districtId": 1757,
      "id": 176887,
      "province": "Adana",
      "district": "Aladağ",
      "name": "Akören",
      "population": 980
    },
    {
      "provinceId": 1,
      "districtId": 1757,
      "id": 248,
      "province": "Adana",
      "district": "Aladağ",
      "name": "Akpınar",
      "population": 654
    }
    // Other neighborhoods...
  ]
}
```

:::

## Getting Single Neighborhood Data

To get a single neighborhood's data, you can create the URL using the neighborhood ID as follows:

```url
https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods/{id}
```

Here you should replace the `{id}` part with the ID of the neighborhood you want to get.

```bash [curl]
curl https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods/176887
```

```javascript [fetch]
fetch('https://turkiyeapi.dev/api/v1/neighborhoods/176887')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

If your request is successful, the API will return a response like this:

::: details Example Response {open}

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": {
    "provinceId": 1,
    "districtId": 1757,
    "id": 176887,
    "province": "Adana",
    "district": "Aladağ",
    "name": "Akören",
    "population": 980
  }
}
```

## Querying

The API provides various parameters for querying neighborhoods. These parameters allow you to filter neighborhoods according to specific criteria. For example, you can get neighborhoods belonging to a specific province or district, filter by population range, or search by neighborhood names.
